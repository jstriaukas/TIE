\title{Qi Estimator (2010)}
\usage{
Qi1(X, m)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector containing the data sample.}

\item{m}{An optional integer specifying the group size for dividing the sample. Defaults to the square root of the sample size.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the estimated tail index.
}
\description{
Computes the Qi (2010) estimator for the tail index of a heavy-tailed distribution.
}
\details{
The Qi estimator divides the data into groups of size \code{m}. Within each group, the Hill estimator is applied to the top \code{k} order statistics, where \code{k = sqrt(m)}. The last group is formed from the remaining observations. The final tail index is computed as the mean of the group-specific Hill estimates.
