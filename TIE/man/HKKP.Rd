\title{Huisman, Koedijk, Kool, and Palm (HKKP) Estimator}
\usage{
HKKP(X, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector containing the data sample.}

\item{k}{An optional integer specifying the number of top-order statistics to use. Defaults to the square root of the sample size.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the estimated tail index.
}
\description{
Computes the Huisman, Koedijk, Kool, and Palm (2001) estimator for the tail index of a heavy-tailed distribution using the method described in Equation 5 of their paper.
}
\details{
This estimator refines the Hill estimator by regressing a sequence of Hill estimates over the number of top-order statistics:
- The Hill estimator is computed for each order statistic from 4 to \( k \).
- A linear regression is performed with the Hill estimates as the dependent variable and the corresponding indices as the independent variable.
- The tail index is extracted as the intercept of the regression line.

This method smooths the variability of the Hill estimates, providing a more stable estimate of the tail index.
