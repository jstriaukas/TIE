\title{Qi Estimator with Permutations}
\usage{
Qi(X, M)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector containing the data sample.}

\item{M}{An optional integer specifying the number of permutations to perform. Defaults to the square root of the sample size.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the estimated tail index.
}
\description{
Computes the Qi (2010) estimator for the tail index of a heavy-tailed distribution using multiple permutations of the data.
}
\details{
The Qi estimator applies the \code{Qi1} function to multiple permutations of the input data:
- For each permutation, the sample is divided into groups, and the Hill estimator is computed for the top-order statistics in each group.
- The final estimate is obtained as the mean of the tail index estimates across all permutations.
This approach improves robustness by incorporating randomness through permutations.

set.seed(123)
