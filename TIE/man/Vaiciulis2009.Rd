\title{Vaiciulis Estimator (2009)}
\usage{
Vaiciulis2009(X, m)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector containing the data sample.}

\item{m}{An optional integer specifying the group size for dividing the sample. Defaults to the square root of the sample size.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the estimated tail index.
}
\description{
Computes the Vaiciulis (2009) estimator for the tail index of a heavy-tailed distribution.
}
\details{
The Vaiciulis (2009) estimator divides the data into overlapping groups of size \code{m}, computes the squared sums for consecutive groups, and calculates the ratio of the absolute difference to the sum of these squared sums. 
- The mean of these ratios (\code{ir}) is then used in a polynomial approximation to compute the tail index.
- The polynomial approximation incorporates trigonometric adjustment (\code{cos(pi * ir / 2)}) for accuracy.

This estimator provides a robust approach for estimating the tail index by leveraging local squared-sum differences.
