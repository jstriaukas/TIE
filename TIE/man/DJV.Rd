\description{
Computes the Danielsson, Jansen, and De Vries (1996) estimator for the tail index of a heavy-tailed distribution.

Computes the Danielsson, Jansen, and De Vries (1996) estimator for the tail index of a heavy-tailed distribution.
}
\details{
The DJV estimator calculates the tail index using the ratio of the first and second moments of the logarithmic differences of the top-order statistics. This method is designed to provide a robust estimate of the tail index.

The DJV estimator calculates the tail index using the ratio of the first and second moments of the logarithmic differences of the top-order statistics:
- \( M_1 \) is the first moment of the logarithmic differences of the top-order statistics.
- \( M_2 \) is the second moment of the logarithmic differences of the top-order statistics.
- The tail index is computed as:
  \[
  \text{Tail Index} = \frac{2 \cdot M_1}{M_2}.
  \]

This estimator is particularly effective for heavy-tailed distributions, leveraging the log-transformed moments of the extreme order statistics.
