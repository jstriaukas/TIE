\title{Brito, Cavalcante, and Freitas (BCF) Estimator}
\usage{
BCF(X, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector containing the data sample.}

\item{k}{An optional integer specifying the number of top-order statistics to use. Defaults to the square root of the sample size.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the estimated tail index.
}
\description{
Computes the Brito, Cavalcante, and Freitas (2016) estimator for the tail index of a heavy-tailed distribution using the method described in Equation 6 of their paper.
}
\details{
This estimator computes the tail index by combining moment-based measures and log-rank statistics:
- Log-rank statistics (\(S_1, S_2\)) are calculated using the ranks of the data.
- Moment-based measures (\(M_1, M_2\)) are derived from the top-order statistics using the \code{MM} function.
- The tail index is calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Tail Index} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{M_2 - M_1^2}{S_1 - S_2}}}.
  \]

This method provides a robust estimate of the tail index by accounting for both moments and rank statistics.
