\usage{
MEP_SCEN(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector containing the data sample.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the estimated tail index.
}
\description{
Computes the McElroy and Politis (2006) RCEN (revised CEN) estimator for the tail index of a heavy-tailed distribution.
}
\details{
The RCEN estimator divides the data into blocks of size \code{b^2}, where \code{b} is the cube root of the sample size (\code{n^(1/3)}). The last block is formed from the remaining observations. For each block, the CEN estimator is applied, and the final tail index is computed as the reciprocal of the mean of the reciprocal tail indices for all blocks.
