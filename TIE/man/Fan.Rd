\title{Fan Estimator}
\usage{
Fan(X, m)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector containing the data sample.}

\item{m}{An optional integer specifying the subsample size for averaging. Defaults to the square root of the sample size.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the estimated tail index.
}
\description{
Computes the Fan (2004) estimator for the tail index of a heavy-tailed distribution, as described in Equation (7) on page 19 of their paper.
}
\details{
This estimator computes the tail index by averaging logarithmic transformations of subsamples:
- The sample is divided into \( N \) random subsamples of size \( m \), drawn with replacement.
- For each subsample, the logarithm of the sum of subsample values is divided by the logarithm of \( m \).
- The tail index is calculated as the reciprocal of the mean of these transformed values.
